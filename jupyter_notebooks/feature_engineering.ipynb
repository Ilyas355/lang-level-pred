    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to prepare the dataset for machine learning by creating, transforming, and encoding features that improve the modelâ€™s ability to predict CEFR levels. Specifically, we aim to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encode the categorical target variable (CEFR levels) into numerical labels suitable for classification.  \n",
    "- Ensure feature scaling/normalization so that all skill scores contribute fairly to the model.  \n",
    "- Explore potential derived features (e.g., average score, skill differences) that may enhance predictive performance.  \n",
    "- Split the dataset into training and test sets with stratification to preserve class distribution.  \n",
    "- Generate a final feature matrix (`X`) and target vector (`y`) ready for model training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cleaned dataset: `data/clean/cleaned_lang_proficiency_results.csv`  \n",
    "- Columns: `speaking_score`, `reading_score`, `listening_score`, `writing_score`, `overall_cefr`  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encoded target labels for CEFR levels  \n",
    "- Scaled/normalized feature set  \n",
    "- Optional engineered features (e.g., mean score, modality balance)  \n",
    "- Train/test splits saved for modeling  \n",
    "- Final processed dataset in a format ready for the ML notebook  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering bridges the gap between raw data and machine learning readiness. Since the business requirement is **automatic learner placement and personalized recommendations**, ensuring that CEFR levels can be predicted accurately depends on well-prepared features. In this step, we transform the raw language skill scores into an optimized input space for classification models, laying the foundation for robust and interpretable predictions.  "
