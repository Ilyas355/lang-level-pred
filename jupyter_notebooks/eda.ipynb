    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform exploratory analysis of the cleaned tabular dataset\n",
    "- Generate descriptive statistics and visual summaries of language proficiency scores\n",
    "- Identify correlations and relationships between different test components\n",
    "- Highlight trends, anomalies, and patterns relevant to CEFR classification and modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cleaned dataset from the Data Cleaning phase (data/processed/lang_proficiency_results.csv)\n",
    "- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas_profiling (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas profiling report or equivalent descriptive overview\n",
    "- Correlation analysis (correlation heatmap, pair plots, or PPS study)\n",
    "- Visualisations of score distributions, relationships, and CEFR class balance\n",
    "- Written insights to inform feature engineering and modelling steps\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional information\n",
    "\n",
    "- All plots will be interpreted in context with the business requirements\n",
    "- Correlations and visual insights will help define predictive features for ML\n",
    "- Any unusual patterns identified here may prompt refinement of cleaning or feature engineering\n"
