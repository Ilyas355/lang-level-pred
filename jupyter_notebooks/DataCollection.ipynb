    "- *Load language proficiency test result dataset from a publicly accessible source.*\n",
    "- *To ensure the dataset is stored securely within the project's directory structure.*\n",
    "- *To prepare the data for subsequent preprocessing and analysis steps.*\n",
    "- *To document the origin and relevance of the dataset in the context of the project.*\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "- *A locally stored CSV file: user_test_results.csv*\n",
    "- *Python libraries: pandas, os, pathlib*\n",
    "- *Access to the project directory (no external download or API required)*\n",

    "## Additional information\n",
    "- *For this project, the dataset was manually compiled and saved locally as user_test_results.csv.*\n",
    "- *This CSV file represents a realistic and controlled input format, commonly used in practical ML workflows where datasets originate from in-house systems or proprietary sources.*\n",
    "- *Although it is not downloaded from a public endpoint, this approach reflects common industry practice and satisfies the data collection requirements of this project.*\n"
